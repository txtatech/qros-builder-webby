# qros-builder-webby
A cross platform linux distribution built with qr code videos that can be loaded in a browser. This is just the base system with all the qr code videos and required scripts to utilize the os in a browser.

Unlike the main branch the release has the **linux.mp4** in it. This release is very early alpha and the web components need lots of implementation. This work is a proof of concept and not intended as a full fledged system. All components of this framework are to be considered materials for testing and educational purposes only. Although some components of this system were able to be tested others have not been tested at all. 

**Use at your own risk.**
